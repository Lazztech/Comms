# Lazztech.Comms Project Architecture Design Document

The objective of this project is fundementally to produce a convenient to deploy and use off grid communication tool. The intention is to expose a web app so that users may connect over a wifi access point with the smart phones they already have and share a two way radio located centrally to their base camp.

This would then allow for comms to be easily deployed and shared upon each base camp.

## 1 - Networking
The objective of this section is to capture the WiFi capabilities and requirement designs. This includes ensuring support for WiFi Roaming between nodes (See appendix link #1).

- connect to AP via qr code

    node1user1[Smartphone User - WiFi Roaming];
    node1user2[Smartphone User - WiFi Roaming];
    node1user1 <--> commsNode1;
    node1user1 <--> commsNode2;
    node1user2 <--> commsNode2;
    node1user2 <--> commsNode3;
```

## 2 - Hardware

Fundementally there are 3 components to setting up a "Comms Node", a computer with WiFi that can serve an access point, a 2 way radio (See appendix link #2), and a means of wiring the radio as an audio input/output device to the computer (See appendix link #3). This has been verified to work as an audio input/output from a computer, while the 2 way radio is configured to enable VOX.

## 3 - Backend
For the backend NestJS will be used (See appendix link #4).

### 3.1 - Audio
Audio manipulation and HLS stream will be managed with ffmpeg(see appendix #5).

This will take place as a child process of the backend, which will be instructed to form an HLS stream from the microphone input, which will be taken from the output of the 2 way radio. It will then be served via the nestjs Serve Static module.

```
# example route of hls stream being served
http://localhost:3000/output.m3u8
```

Additionally FFMPEG may be instructed to keep a set number of HLS segments then auto delete the old segments. This reduces file storage concerns as it cleans up after itself.

## 4 - Frontend
Low-js HOWL Stack(Hypermedia On Whatever youâ€™d Like). And what I'd like is NestJS MVC with HandlebarsJS as the templating engine. For styling pines UI fills any remaining gaps with a tailwind and alpinejs based component library.
